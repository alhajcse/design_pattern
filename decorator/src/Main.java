/*Suppose we are building a coffee shop application where customers can order different
types of coffee. Each coffee can have various optional add-ons such as
milk, sugar, whipped cream, etc. We want to implement a system where we can dynamically
add these add-ons to a coffee order without modifying the coffee classes themselves.*/
